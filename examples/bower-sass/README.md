# Bower-Sass
Example of using bower and SASS with react, also bootstrap added as a novelty.

We are also using AJAX for getting countries list from server after component did mount.

## Install
Install all required stuff for js and python by using make file.
`make install`

Otherwise you can install them one by one like this.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install all python dependencies
npm install  # install all JS dependencies
bower install  # install all bower componenets
```

## Usage
```bash
make install  #
make build  # build & watch js with gulp
make run   # run python server
```
